He started playing musical instruments at an early age and quickly progressed to become an accomplished keyboard player. Getting into dance music in his home country, the young Sicilian was perfectly positioned in 1989 to witness the rise of Italo House. Rapidly caught up in his country's embryonic electronic dance sound, he watched its influence spread quickly around the world. A year later he started to DJ, initially concentrating his energies inside the country and playing a mix of early progressive twinned with techno that was coming over from the States.   \n  \nIt wasn't until five years later though (in 1995) that Gai himself started to experiment musically in the studio, initially working on more minimally minded tracks. With a love of travel and an inbuilt wanderlust he began to country hop, moving first to Germany in 1998 and then transferring to the UK. Continuing to learn the studio craft, he built up a huge range of tracks and ideas for tracks ranging right the way from chillout to hard house. It wasn't until 2008 (at the age of 33) though that Barone really started to fix on a professional studio career. His focus finally landed at the door of progressive house and trance and his first EP, 'Solegirasoli' was signed to Ultimate House Records. Appearing on the radar of a number of the bigger DJ names for the first time, he consolidated this with the tribally progressive track 'Moving' for the Mesmerized imprint, which was flipped by the 'Pemba'. This in turn brought him to the attention of Ask4 Records. Keen to record for the fast-rising label, he produced the rapaciously euphoric trancer 'Appetite' which was released in late 2008.  \n  \nIt was at this point that a catalyzing factor was needed in Gai's career and those stars aligned with his signing to Plastic Angel's Afterglow imprint and the subsequent release of 'Lilith'. A trancer of remarkable depth and sophistication, it received the 5/5 'Money Shot' accolade in DJ Magazine, who called it \"audio-excellence\" and said it delivered a \"lump-in-the-throat climax\". Backed by a remix from Jerome Isma Ae, it was greeted with plaudits by DJs around the world, became a Beatport sensation and undisputedly went on to become Gai Barone's world-stage calling card.   \n  \n'Organum' (with its remix from fellow countryman Dino Lenny) quickly followed it, as requests for Gai Barone remixes from the likes of Markus Schulz (who named him as one of the top 5 newcomers of 2009), Store n Forward, Egostereo, Markus Schulz, Jim Rivers, Andy Moor, Dino Lenny, Cid Inc. and many more.  \n  \nNow carving out a dark, provocative, increasingly recognizable soundscape with each one of productions, Gai Barone stands on the threshold of an electronic dance music breakthrough.\n\nhttp://soundcloud.com/gai-barone  \nhttp://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/gaibarone  \nhttp://www.myspace.com/gaibaronelounge  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/gaibarone  \nhttp://www.facebook.com/gaibarone  \nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/gai+barone  \nhttp://twitter.com/#!/GaiBarone  \n","id":15370,"name":"Patterns","parent_show_id":null,"artists_tagline":"with Gai Barone","description_html":"<p><strong>Gai Barone</strong><br>\nA relatively new name to some he may very well be, but Italy&#39;s Gai Barone has a much longer history in dance music than you might think.   </p>\n\n<p>Brought up on an eclectic musical diet, Barone initially immersed himself in classical and hip hop (and a fair few shades in between).

As with the rise of Arty before him, Omnia has picked-up the baton to lead the Eastern European EDM takeover in 2013 with notable highlights in a packed DJ schedule including festivals such as Global Gathering UK & Ukraine, Ultra Argentina, A State Of Trance 600 Holland, Trancefusion Czech Republic, Summadayze Australia as well as global club brands such as Ministry Of Sound, Zouk, Papaya, Privilege & Eden Ibiza, Ageha and Ellui.\n\nOmnia's imagination was first captured by dance music sounds as a young boy in the late 90's and early 2000's. By his late teens Omnia had started to experiment with music production with a particular love of trance, but with influences drawn from many genres that have been his passion for over a decade. Self-taught in the studio, Omnia's sound has a distinctive edge and a style that refuses to be pigeon holed. His productions started to gain international recognition in 2011 with the likes of Armin van Buuren and Markus Schulz supporting his early releases which included a remix of Arty & Mat Zo 'Rebound'.\n\nWhile 2011 was an exciting year for Omnia musically, not even he could have anticipated the massive breakthrough year he'd have in 2012. The catalyst for this was Omnia & Ira 'The Fusion' which went on to be one of the biggest tracks of the year across all dance genres, hitting #1 in the Trance chart in April and remaining in the Top 50 positions for over six months. He went on to repeat chart success time and time again, raising the bar of his studio output to deliver a run of massive singles and remixes; 'Halo' feat. Melissa Loretta was awarded 'Future Favourite' by Armin on ASOT and further chart topping singles followed with 'Infina' and 'Hearts Connected' feat. Cathy Burton, plus remixes of similar stature provided for Cosmic Gate feat. Emma Hewitt 'Calm Down' and Ashley Wallbridge feat. Audrey Gallagher 'Bang The Drum'. Each release left the EDM community spellbound and further fuelled demand for the distinctive Omnia sounds.\n\nMoving into 2013 and Omnia has maintained his momentum on the production front to ensure his name is pushed to the top of DJ, fan and record label wish-lists the world over. Further standout releases include Beatport #1 singles 'The Light' and 'Immersion', a remix of Ronski Speed feat. Lucy Saunders 'Rise Again', plus the imminent release of his eagerly anticipated 'Bones' feat. Everything By Electricity which looks destined to set a new benchmark for future Omnia singles to be measured by.\n\nLooking ahead and Omnia is set to make his mixing debut on a compilation series at the start of 2014, having been invited by Armin van Buuren to mix one disc of his 'A State Of Trance 650' CD which is scheduled for release in January. With further big singles, remixes and some special collaborations tracks also planned, expect to see Omnia's star shining brightly into the New Year.

Her passion for success, hit singles on the Beatport charts, extensive global touring, and musical creativity has Sydney at the top of the electronic music scene. \n\nOriginally from Canada and currently based in Los Angeles, Sydney Blu's success has been built-upon numerous hit singles and relentless world touring. Following the success of her releases (including the chart-topping 'Give It Up For Me' on Mau5trap Recordings being one of Beatport's highest selling songs and making Sydney the first female electronic producer to ever have a top 10 hit on the website), Sydney Blu developed and founded her own record label Blu Music, which has produced several chart-topping singles over the years. A steady support from global heavyweights such as Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Deadmau5, Robbie Rivera, & Funkagenda has propelled Sydney Blu and Blu Music to the forefront of the dance music scene, as well as the top of the charts. \n \nAfter moving to Miami in Spring of 2010, Sydney Blu quickly set-up her residency with Opium Group and Mansion Miami, the hottest club in South Beach. Quickly thereafter, relentless worldwide touring followed with North American highlights including massive headlining shows at Pacha NYC, Space Miami, Avalon Los Angeles, and Beta Denver just to name a few. Sydney also headlined in front of 10,000+ people this past summer in Recife Brazil, and then 25 thousand people this past November 2011 at the Rogers Centre Toronto, closing out the Deadmau5 Meowingtons Hax Tour. The event was the biggest dance event in Canadian history. On the global stage, Sydney Blu has rocked crowds with performances in Europe, Brazil, Colombia, Philippines, Mexico, Tunisia, Pakistan as well as a headlining slot in front of 5000 people in Egypt over the Easter holiday. She's headlined some of the biggest clubs in the world including Space (Ibiza), Republiq (Manila), Space (Miami), El Pacha (Tunisia, Africa), Eazy Club (Sao Paulo, Brazil), BPM Festival (Playa Del Carmen, Mexico), Avalon (Los Angeles), The End (Colombia) and Guvernment Nightclub (Toronto) all having fans urning for more from the talented artist.\n \nSydney Blu and Blu Music consistently hit the Beatport charts over the past year, with releases like Chemistry on Blackhole Recordings as well as her most recent single Another Late Night featuring MC Flipside. Also her remixes of Luciana's 'Calling all the Lovers', 'Givin it Up' by The Goodmen and a re-edit of Jefferson Airplane titled 'Want Somebody' topped the charts for weeks. As well, Blu's label had one of it's biggest hits this past year with Trent Cantrelle's 'I Wanna Freak' topping the Beatport Top 10 and holding the #1 House song on the website for 3 months. The song was nominated as a finalist for #1 House song of 2011. All of Sydney's releases receive consistent support from global heavyweights such as Thomas Gold, NERVO, Tiesto, Roger Sanchez, Robbie Rivera, Paul Oakenfold, Chuckie, Ferry Corsten, Oscar G, Funkagenda, Chris Lake & more.\n \nIn addition to her record label, Sydney's Blu Party brand has hosted it's annual event Miami Music Week for the past 4 years. The Blu Party has been known to be one of the most well-respected WMC/MMW parties, with a penchant for debuting A-list & untapped talent. Recent headliners of the Blu Party in past years have included artists such as Thomas Gold, John Dahlback, Funkagenda, Tommy Lee & Dj Aero, David Tort, Alex Kenji, SOFI, Kim Fai, Wally Lopez, Manuel De La Mar and many more.\n\nSydney is also spending most of her year with her label Black Hole Recordings presenting a biographical documentary series\ntitled \"Being Sydney Blu\". Each episode will be beyond how you see Sydney Blu as a Dj, giving the viewer an exclusive inside look on her\ndaily life as a regular person. The viewer will get to experience first hand the hard work that Sydney goes through in her career, along\nwhat she does in her free time to get away from it all. She will be releasing a new episode every month at a new location based around her\nshow schedule.  \n\n2013 proved to be busy with original tracks and remixes released on Dim Mak Records, Big Beat, Spinnin Records, Hotfingers, Funkfarm Records, and a compilation album on Black Hole Recordings. 2014 is the year of a forthcoming artist album on Black Hole as well as many releases on Blu Music and more. Her full length live album on Nervous Records, 'Sydney Blu: Live at Mansion' raced up the itunes dance charts last year with a massive summer tour that took her all North & South America. \n\nWith an even more explosive touring schedule that is set to push her even further to success across 5 continents, 2014 is looking bright for the super fresh and accomplished SYDNEY BLU.\n","id":10548292,"name":"Blu Radio","parent_show_id":null,"artists_tagline":"with Sydney Blu","description_html":"<p>Sydney Blu continues to establish herself as one of the top female electronic producers and Dj&#39;s in the world.

Over the course of his career Yves V has risen to international standing amongst his peers and global dance fans, as a producer and DJ of high acclaim. Whilst his music now fills the playlists of the biggest DJs on the planet, his name can also be found listed on billings for some of the most prestigious parties in the world. His sets have illuminated the mainstage of iconic events that include all soon-to-be three Tomorrowland events, Sensation, David Guetta in Concert and Mysteryland, whilst triumphantly winning over the dancefloors at some of the scene's most iconic clubs, including Guaba, Anzu Club, Nikki Beach and Pacha. On the road his global exploits have led to a series of long and successful tours throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, Cyprus, Spain, France, Finland, Italy, Greece and his native home of Belgium. The Summer of 2014 saw Yves embark on his biggest international dates yet, from dominating the #1 club in the world at Brazil's Green Valley, as he zig-zagged south of the equator, over to a mini India tour that saw him hit Mumbai, New Delhi, Jaipur and Indore, gaining recognition from the likes of Rolling Stone India and whipping fans into a frenzy, both those who have been present since the beginning of his career, as well as the new invitees to his signature sound.\n\nFrom the studio, his music is vacuum-packed and released on the dancefloor by every major artist from Tiësto and Hardwell, to Sander van Doorn and Steve Angello. His remix of 'Insane Pressure' was the release that broke Yves into the consciousness of his peers and since then, his productions have grown from underground bangers into Beatport chart Top 10 hits, of which include 'Madagascar' Ft Dimitri Vegas, Like Mike & Angger Dimas, and 'Cloudbreaker' Ft Basto. Whilst his remix work encompasses A-list artists with a hip-hop flavour, such as putting his stamp on the releases of Timbaland, Missy Elliott and Ginuwine, all of this has led to Yves' own productions being released on a plethora of the best record labels in Armada, Dirty Dutch and Magik Music. His single 'Sonica' (Running on a Highway)' was released on Spinnin' records becoming a firm favourite with fans at Yves' festival appearances, along with 'Old Skool Sound' (feat. Chukie) following similar suit, whilst his collaboration with Sander van Doorn titled 'Direct Dizko' (on Doorn records), landed a Top 10 position in the Beatport charts and claimed the #1 spot in the Buzz Charts. Next in store, Yves offers up a party-starting anthem in the form of the Summer hit 'Wait Till Tomorrow', with Regi feat. Mitch Crown. Receiving its official world premier on Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike's Smash The House Radio back in June, 'Wait Till Tomorrow's infectious vocal hook and undeniable anthem status has made it the track of the festival season, Yves' releases equally on the dance floor and airwaves gaining support from heavyweights like Hardwell, David Guetta, Afrojack, Martin Garrix, Armin van Buuren and Radio 1's Danny Howard and Pete Tong.\n\n// Tomorrowland + TomorrowWorld //\nAn integral part of the Tomorrowland musical makeup, Yves' residency for one of the biggest and most awe-inspiring festivals on the planet has led him to feature non less than a staggering eight times on the Tomorrowland mainstage - a feat no other DJ has surpassed.

Having performed alongside the biggest names in the electronic scene on what is arguably the most buzzed about festival in the world, Yves has garnered a glowing reputation amongst his peers, as he has amongst the legions of music fans that emphatically follow his every release and DJ set.

Celebrating the festival's tenth anniversary, the three-CD exclusive compilation includes a personally curated mix from Yves, reflecting his stand-out tracks that trigger memories of the world's biggest electronic music festival since its inception, allowing even those unable to attend to have a piece of the legend within their home.\n\n// V Sessions //\nCloaking his successes, ideas and musical direction around his V-Sessions brand has enabled Yves to bring to the life his unwavering passion through a series of exclusive events, an internationally respected radio show - which is syndicated on more than 30 stations worldwide - and his famed Tomorrowland stage-host.\nThrough the encouragement of the Tomorrowland team, Yves was invited to curate his own V-Sessions stage at the 2012 edition of the festival.

We managed to dig into old archives of the late 90s and early 2000s, and this is the result : darker, super psychedelic old schoolish goa-trance!\n\nThe album starts with long, hypnotic, darker goa-trance tracks, slowly entering more melodic, spiralling territories!

Music was his first love since his early youth. He started playing piano when he was only five. Being a very creative student, Afrojack spent most of his time listening to all kinds of music while studying. It was no surprise that it didn't take him long to turn the tables and start making music instead of just listening to it.\n\nAt the age of 11, Afrojack gets hold of a program called Fruity loops. At this point in time his talent and passion for creating music truly surfaces. Rapidly acquainting himself with and appreciating Fruity Loops, it becomes his program of choice, which he uses to this day. Afrojack finishes school and decides to proceed with his musical career. Not being able to make a living out of it yet, he starts to work part-time in bars and catering. Now he has more than enough time to discover the club scene in Rotterdam, starting with his first night out in the old club Las Palmas when he was only 16 years old. After this, many club nights, side-jobs, small DJ-gigs for the fun of deejaying and a lot of studio time followed.\n\nIn 2006 he sets off to Crete (Greece) deejaying for five full months straight in every club that would have him, learning the craft and making his first 'flight hours'. It was also in Crete where he landed his first small hit. When returning home to the Netherlands, he was fired up and started producing more and more tracks, determined to get his productions released on a label. With a little help from Sidney Samson and Laidback Luke, Digidance decides to give it a shot, and it worked; 'Afrojack - In Your Face' scored #60 in the Dutch Top 100 and #3 in the Dutch dance Top 30. Not too bad for the first release of an 18 year old kid.\n\nIn 2007 Nick starts performing under the name Afrojack, determined to try to make it to the top as a DJ and producer. Track after track and remix after remix follows and he even starts his own label 'Wall Recordings'. Afrojack is rarely seen outside of his studio. When he's not deejaying, he is producing and it starts to pay off. His tracks start being supported by international DJ's like Josh Wink, Dave Clarke, Laidback Luke, Fedde Le Grand, Marco V and Benny Rodrigues.\n\nIn 2008 he hits the clubs with 'Math' and 'Do My Dance' and both tracks get picked up by every big name in the industry. Afrojack hooks up with the Partysquad to add vocals to \"Do My Dance\"and a couple of weeks later, the 'Drop Down (Do My Dance)' co-op mix is born. This track hits the Dutch top 20 and gets crowned \"Tune of the Week\" by the biggest Dutch radio stations. Afrojack starts appearing at many important festivals, like Mystery Land, Tomorrowland (Belgium), Extrema Outdoor and Sensation.\n\nThe world heard more and more from Afrojack in 2009 and it didn't take a long time for David Guetta to notice Afrojack's talent. They decided to meet up in the studio, which resulted in 'Toyfriend', a collaboration between the two.\n\nBefitting his position as the leading figure of the Dutch new wave, his success stretches far beyond his home turf; 2010 has seen him become one of the most in demand DJ/producers of any nationality.\n\nWith a peerless reputation as a producer , his signature style is bringing him the kind of remix requests that most dance artists will only ever dream of. (for example Lady Gaga's 'Alejandro' and Madonna's 'Revolver')\n\nGig-wise, he's rocked the world's biggest floors including Pacha Ibiza, Miami Ultra Music Festival and Electric Daisy Carnival in LA.\n\nAfrojack's rise to fame as a producer has brought him a roll call of A-list champions - from Pete Tong to David Guetta, and Josh Wink to Fedde Le Grand, along the way collaborating with some of the world's most respected producers and artists like David Guetta, Steve Aoki, Diplo, Kid Cudi, Pitbull and Black Eyed Peas.\n\nIn 2011 Afrojack was rewarded with the respectable Grammy award for the remix of Madonna's 'Revolver' in collaboration with David Guetta.\n\nRespected by his colleague DJ's for his production skills and loved by clubbers for his dancefloor bombs and energetic performances, Afrojack is setting new standards in the industry.","id":10553723,"name":"Jacked Radio","parent_show_id":null,"artists_tagline":"with Afrojack","description_html":"<p>The stars must&#39;ve been aligned just right when Nick van de Wall (better known as Afrojack) saw his first ray of light.

He is mixing the hip-hop vibe with house Music like no one else!\" said David Guetta.\n\nChuckie: The Success\n\nChuckie has been awarded several times for his work and received his first Award for \"Best Urban DJ\" in 2004. Nearly after a year, he prolonged this title and won the \"Best Club DJ Award\". In 2006 he was nominated by the Dutch TMF Awards, along with Tiësto, Armin van Buuren and G Spotts, for the title \"Best Dance\". In addition to his busy career, Chuckie also spent time on charity and is the ambassador of UNICEF Den Haag, the integration plan \"&\" and the Red Cross initiative \"B the change\".

Old as they are,contemplativesounds continue to evolve. Producer Hill says &quot;What&#39;snow beingcalled Ambient music is the latest chapter in thecontemplativemusic experience. Electronic instruments have creatednewexpressive possibilities, but the coordinates of thatexpressionremain the same. Space-creating sound is the medium.Moving,significant music is the goal.&quot; The ancient resonances ofdrums,bells, and flutes, the exotic tones of gongs and gamelans,thedigital sounds of the Ambient frontier.
